    <ul>
      <li><b>Total:</b> Approximately 28 minutes</li>
      <li><b>Preparation:</b> 15 minutes</li>
      <li><b>Cooking:</b> 13 minutes</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
    
      <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
      <li>4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup packed with dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon red food coloring, preferably McCormick brand</li>
      <li>2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/4 cup natural cocoa powder (not Dutch process)</li>
      <li>2 cups white chocolate baking chips, divided</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Method</h2>

    <ol>

      <li><b>Preheat the oven to 350F:</b>Line two baking sheets with a silicon baking mat or parchment paper.</li>
      <li><b>Begin making the batter:</b>Place the butter, cream cheese, both sugars, baking soda, salt, and vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed until the mixture is creamy, uniform in color, and clings to the side of the bowl, about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
      <li> Add the egg and egg yolk:</b>Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula and add the egg. Mix to incorporate on medium speed. Repeat with the egg yolk, and then the red food coloring, mixing on slow speed to avoid splattering the red food coloring.</li>
      </li>
      <li><b>Add the flour and cocoa powder:</b>Mix on low until the dry ingredients are just absorbed.</li>
      <li><b>Add the white chips:</b>Add 1 1/2 cups of the baking chips to the dough, reserving 1/2 cup of chips for topping the cookies. Slowly mix in until the baking chips are evenly distributed.</li>
      <li><b>Shape the cookies:</b>Wet your hands under water then slightly dry them with a paper towel. With your hands still moist, roll out 1-inch balls (heaping tablespoons) of dough, placing them on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
      <li><b>Bake the cookies:</b>Bake the cookies, one baking sheet at a time, for 11 to 13 minutes or until the edges of the cookie are dry and set. The cookies will look a bit puffy and plump.</li>
      <li><b>Top the chips:</b>While the cookies are still warm, press several white chips into the top of the cookies while they are still hot and puffy. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring the cookies to a wire cooling rack. The cookies will deflate a bit and flatten slightly as they cool. Repeat with the remaining dough.</li>

    </ol>
